#Translation Service - Development Roadmap
##Introduction
This document outlines the future development plans for the Translation Service. The roadmap includes both functional and non-functional improvements aimed at enhancing the service's capabilities, reliability, and performance.

##Functional Enhancements
#### 1. Scrapping Improvement:

- Refine the scrapping accuracy, specifically in more precisely identifying the 'definition' block.
- Enhance requirement specifications to improve scrapping capabilities.

####2. Language Auto-Detection Support:

- Implement functionality to automatically detect the language of input text.

#### 3. Handling and Validation of Incorrect Words:

- Develop processes to handle and validate words that are incorrect or not recognized.

#### 4. Catalogue and Validation of Available Languages:

- Create a comprehensive catalog of supported languages.
- Implement validation to ensure language compatibility and availability.

#### 5. Error Handling from Various System Components:

- Enhance the system's capability to manage and respond to errors from different components effectively.

#### 6. Expansion of Unit Tests:

- Extend the existing unit tests, currently focused on the WordPgRepo class, to cover more components and scenarios.


##Non-Functional Improvements

#### 1. Database Partitioning:

- Consider implementing database partitions for languages to manage increased load efficiently.

#### 2. SQL Query Optimization:

- Identify opportunities to optimize SQL queries for better performance.

#### 3. Application Stability:

- Focus on enhancing the application's resilience and tolerance to failures of external systems.

#### 4. High Load Optimizations:

- Investigate and implement optimizations for handling high-load scenarios, including potential enhancements in converting objects to domain models.

## Production-Readiness

#### 1. Logging:

- Implement comprehensive logging mechanisms to facilitate effective debugging and issue resolution.

#### 2.2 Monitoring:

- Set up robust monitoring systems to track the application's performance and health in real-time.

#### 3. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

- Establish CI/CD pipelines to streamline development, testing, and deployment processes.

#### 4. Secrets Management:

- Securely manage secrets, credentials, and other sensitive information required by the application.

## Conclusion

This roadmap aims to guide the Translation Service towards significant improvements in both functionality and infrastructure. The focus is on enhancing user experience, system stability, and preparing the service for a production environment.
